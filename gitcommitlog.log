Thu Sep 22 03:34:28 2016 -0600 - u1089885: Full loop in effect. UFO waves come when all the humans get into the buildings. They can damage the building. we really need to tighten up the dimensions of the game. everything is much too large. Also, there's a few bugs - hospital image doesn't reset properly at the start of a new round, but it will once the first person is returned to it in that next round. Also, you should lose sooner if you kill too many people and you won't be able to return them all. This should also be a clear visual indicator or somehow the player should know the importance of how many 'extra' people they have left. Super pumped about the joystick too. Still need to add many of the art assets and sfx as well
